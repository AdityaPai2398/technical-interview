# Finding the Right Job

Unfortunately, the simple truth is that you need to do what feels right for you, and only YOU really know what that is. That said, here is some perspective on being a new software engineer entering the workforce:

## There ARE jobs out there

There are a LOT of tech jobs out there. It's an odd thing to say when there are so many people left looking for work, but for the time being, the information technology field offers the luxury of higher demand than skilled labor to match it. Therefore, IT professionals have *some* (though not unlimited) luxury in being picky. You have far more options than, say, a marine biologist living in one of the Dakota states. There are options for IT in pretty much every major metropolitan area, not to mention increasing numbers of remote working opportunities at companies with distributed teams.

So, don't feel that you have to take the first opportunity that comes along. Look for a job that feels exciting and personally satisfying.

## Your future boss(es)

Perhaps the most important thing to consider at the front door of any opportunity is the power ladder. The fact of the matter is: if you can't tolerate or respect those who would be your superiors, you'll probably be unhappy under abhorrent figures of authority.

Therefore, you should be interviewing your future boss(es) (as many as possible) as they interview you. Your peers are less important: sibling rivalries are a fact of life. We have to put up with different personalities throughout, and that's okay. We learn from it. As long as you feel that you can cultivate an amicable relationship with your future boss figure, then a job opportunity just comes down to weighing its tangible benefits...

## Jobs have many facets

Any job is a balance of factors that are personalized to you: growth, challenge, creativity, prestige, compensation, schedule, commute, etc. When in doubt, consider the Buddhist approach which suggests that, "The Path", is that which avoids suffering and promotes happiness. Those seem like excellent guidelines when planning an activity that will consume 33+% of your life.

When reviewing a job opportunity, consider this question: what do you value? Less glamorous work may be lucrative if it buys you time (commute/schedule) or compensation (salary/benefits).  That said however, working on something that you don't enjoy or don't care about probably isn't healthy without a strong personal factor to redeem it (such as: saving the fuzzy-wuzzies of wherever, or making more income to support your family).

## Your choice

These considerations are why selecting the right job is such a personal persuit: only you can match the values in your life against the offerings of a job. The good news is though, there's really only one *wrong* reason to take a job, and this is: simply because it was offered.

Good luck, and may the Force be with you.
