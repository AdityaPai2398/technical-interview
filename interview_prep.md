# Technical Interview Preparation

Here are some items to have ready before going into a technical interview session:

## Basic Prep

* **Print your resume and cover letter**, and have them ready to hand out to interviewers. Physical printed medium is your hand-to-hand combat interview material. Do NOT assume that your interviewers have prepped on your background (they have jobs, and are busy). Providing them with a queue sheet about yourself steers them to towards your actual strengths and background, rather than letting them blindly go fishing.

* **Think of a peer-to-peer conflict scenario** that you've experienced with a teammate. Think of how to positively present this story, and file it away in your memory. You'll be surprised at how many interpersonal questions can be fielded using this one story.

* **Think of a really challenging technical problem** that you've experienced and resolved. Think of how to present it, and file it away in your memory. Again, you'll be surprised at how many technical experience questions you can throw this story against.

* **Select a code sample**, and have it ready to present. The best code samples are small, self-contained, and easily presented in a single screen. Code is really boring, so be prepared to present your code as a story (using your people skills!):
 
  1. Identify a single, finite problem that you encountered.
  2. Identify obstacles that made this problem unique and challenging.
  3. Indentify your thought processes that led you to a solution.
  4. Present the final code solution. Keep it brief. Code is boring and ugly, and interviewer don't actually care to see it. If you've succeeded at steps 1-3, then step-4 is a formality. If you failed at steps 1-3, then step-4 prolongs a bad situation.

* **Consider about your skills trajectory**, see: [https://coggle.it/diagram/Vz9LvW8byvN0I38x](https://coggle.it/diagram/Vz9LvW8byvN0I38x)

## Serious Prep

If you want to get *really* serious about an interview, then go digging:

* **Review their public code**. If they have a public-facing web product, then you have full, guilt-free access to their client-side methodology. Look over their HTML structure, figure out what JavaScript libraries they're using, look at their routing structures, etc. If you hit them with deep, insightful questions about their own technology, it's difficult not to make an impression.

* **Review their people**. Many times a company's HR department will send you a list of names of the specific people you'll be meeting with. IT professionals have a public Internet footprint a mile wide, so you can easily find them on LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, etc. Now, this takes some finesse: there's a fine line between impressing an interview panel with your keen insights, and freaking them out with overly presumptuous insights. The best balance here is to get a sense of who you're meeting with, and play that knowledge close to the chest. It may give you clues as to their lines of questioning based on their backgrounds. You may also score points by dropping knowledge squarely onto their areas of focus.
